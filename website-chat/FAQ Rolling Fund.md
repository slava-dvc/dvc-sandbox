# FAQ - Rolling Fund

## GPs

- **GPs biography**
    
    DVC was founded by Marina and Nick Davidovs, a family of founders with 15 years of experience in early-stage VC and product building, including 9 years focused on AI, and with multiple successful exits. 3 more partners (GP) include a former Yahoo and Google exec with multiple unicorns invested on seed, an ex-Meta, and Google AI product director, and an Oscar-winning filmmaker who sold his tech startup to Microsoft. Everyone in GP is a founder, technical, and with at least 10+ years investing as VC/angel.
    
    Nick and Marina Davidovs manage the DVC AI Fund alongside their $38+ rolling fund, Davidovs VC (DVC). In 3.5 years the rolling fund has invested in 120 early-stage startups by repeat founders in AI.  The fund is backed by a community of limited partners, that are engineers, founders, and angel investors  in Silicon Valley. The LPs actively participate in investment decisions, portfolio management, and provide valuable expertise and network connections to portfolio founders.
    Before establishing DVC, the Davidovs co-founded Cherry Labs, an AI camera startup that was acquired post-Series A, and Gagarin Capital, an AI-focused VC fund. They have also invested in and advised numerous early-stage AI startups, such as Prisma Labs (100M+ users), MSQRD (30M users, acquired by Meta), and AIMatter (acquired by Google). Prior to these ventures, Nick served as the founding employee and Director of Investments at iTech Capital, a $120M seed/series A VC firm with notable seed/A investments in Trading View ($3.5B), Bitfury ($2B), and Ecwid ($500M).
    

## Rolling Fund

- **How is this program different from venture fund investing?**
    
    Davidovs Venture Capital is structured as a series of quarterly funds.Unlike investing in a venture fund, when a Limited Partner (LP) invests in Davidovs Venture Capital:
    
    1. An LP follows a flexible, quarterly investment schedule rather than a one-time commitment to a fund. An LP participates in investments Davidovs Venture Capital makes for each quarterly fund the LP invests in.
    2. LPs can subscribe for future quarterly funds in advance and easily commit more or less capital as their investment goals change.
- **How do subscriptions work?**
    
    New quarterly funds in this Program are created each quarter to invest in on-thesis deals sourced during the quarter. By subscribing, an LP commits to make the subscribed-for capital contribution to each quarterly fund offered through this Program. Each LP is then able to modify or cancel its subscription before the beginning of any subsequent quarterly fund, after meeting the number of quarterly subscriptions the LP initially commits to.
    
    An LP's subscription into a quarterly fund also provides that investable capital remaining at the end of the quarterly fund's deployment period may be automatically rolled over into a subsequent quarterly fund. When this happens, an LP receives a corresponding contribution to the subsequent quarterly fund in addition to whatever amount it subscribes for and contributes directly into the subsequent quarterly fund.
    
- **How do management and admin fees work?**
    
    The quarterly funds offered through the Program each pay a management fee in an amount equal to 2% per annum for the quarterly fund's 10-year life. The management fee is paid quarterly over the fund's first four years. Davidovs Venture Capital may reduce or waive fees for certain investors and not others. In addition to the management fee, each quarterly fund may reserve and pay venture fund expenses.
    
    AngelList launches and maintains each quarterly fund throughout its lifetime and charges an administrative fee for such services. The administrative fee for each quarterly fund paid to AngelList (or its affiliates) is composed of a setup fee and an annual fee. The setup fee will be paid out as of the initial closing of the quarterly fund and will be a flat $20k fee born ratably by limited partners as a fund expense. The annual fee shall be 0.15% of contributed capital, and will be paid in advance, on a quarterly basis. The annual fee shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the setup fee and such reduction shall be applied proportionately over the first 10 years of the fund's term. Other fees incurred by AngelList on the fund's behalf may be passed through to the fund, such as blue sky and other regulatory fees, and born ratably by LPs.
    
    Starting Q1 2025, this Rolling Fund will transition onto updated Rolling Fund pricing terms. Under these new pricing terms, the administrative fee paid to AngelList (or its affiliates) for each subsequent quarterly fund in the Rolling Fund Program will be composed of a setup fee and an annual fee. The setup fee will be paid out at the initial closing of the quarterly fund and will be a flat $20k fee born ratably by limited partners as a fund expense. The annual fee is composed of a $500 flat fee and 0.2% of the quarterly fund’s total contributed capital. Other fees incurred by AngelList on the fund’s behalf may be passed through to the fund, such as blue sky and other regulatory fees, and born ratably by LPs.
    
    Fees for each quarterly fund in the Rolling Fund Program will vary based on each quarterly fund’s capital contributions since the fee includes a flat fee component. 
    
- **How does carried interest work?**
    
    Carried interest payment is calculated across a Limited Partner's subscription period. The subscription period is the number of quarters to which a Limited Partner subscribes in advance. Depending on the options provided by the fund manager, a Limited Partner may have a quarter-by-quarter subscription period or a multi-quarter subscription period.
    
    If on a quarter-by-quarter subscription period, the Limited Partner must be repaid only the amount they contributed to the quarterly fund experiencing the exit before that Limited Partner begins to pay carried interest.
    
    If on a multi-quarter subscription period, the Limited Partner must be repaid the total amount they contributed to all quarterly funds within that subscription period before that Limited Partner begins to pay carried interest.
    
    Certain LPs may pay more or less carry at the discretion of Davidovs Venture Capital or the funds' investment adviser.
    
    For Davidovs Venture Capital, an LP will pay 20% total carried interest once they have received back 100% of their contributions made during each subscription term.
    
- **How do distributions work?**
    
    Subscribing LPs participate only in distributions from the quarterly funds to which they contribute. An LP has no interest in portfolio investments of quarterly funds formed before their subscription was accepted or after it is canceled or rejected.
    
    As a quarterly fund exits its investments, LPs in that quarterly fund will receive distributions net of fees and any applicable carry. Funds that have not exited all investments by the end of their lifespan will ordinarily be liquidated, subject to the terms of the applicable fund documents. LPs should be prepared to hold their interest in each quarterly fund for its full term.
    
- **Will a Limited Partner (LP) participate in all investments made by the funds offered through this Program?**
    
    An LP will only participate in investments made by the quarterly funds they subscribed to. If an LP cancels or fails to fund their subscription, the LP will no longer participate in future quarterly funds (subject to any reinvestment of rollover capital). A failure to fund a subscription may be subject to customary fund penalties.
    
- **Will an LP's percentage ownership of quarterly funds always be the same?**
    
    No. An LP's pro rata share of funds under this Program may change from quarter-to-quarter based on changes in its subscription amount and the subscriptions made by other LPs. For example, if new LPs join this Program over time and an existing LP does not increase its subscription amount, its pro rata share will decrease in future funds.
    
- **Are LPs guaranteed access to Davidovs Venture Capital's future funds?**
    
    No. Davidovs Venture Capital or AngelList may cancel an LP's subscription in upcoming quarterly funds or cease offering funds under this Program altogether at any time. Also, investors in this Program will have no right to participate in funds offered outside of this Program.
    
- **How are subscriptions funded?**
    
    Subscriptions are funded either through wire or via ACH transfer using information submitted through the AngelList Platform. LPs must fund their subscriptions by the funding deadline indicated on the Platform. If an LP authorizes payment of its subscription by ACH and the LP's AngelList account balance doesn't cover the LP's full subscription, the remaining balance will be transferred automatically via ACH from the LP's bank account on the funding deadline date. 
    
    LPs will generally transfer their subscription amount once per quarter. If the initial close of the Program takes place after a fiscal quarter has already begun, the period between the first and second transfers may be less than a quarter.
    
- **How does changing or canceling a subscription work?**
    
    Typically, LPs may increase, decrease, or cancel their subscription amount at any time prior to the subscription deadline for a quarterly fund. LPs that subscribe with a subscription period of two or more quarters must fulfill their subscription period commitments before decreasing or canceling their subscription. LPs can make updates to their subscription from their portfolio and from the Rolling Fund's fund page.
    
    Unless modified, an LP's subscription amount and period will auto-renew such that after a subscription period ends, another subscription period of the same quarterly length and commitment amount begins.
    
- **Who manages these funds?**
    
    Investment opportunities are sourced by Davidovs Venture Capital and reviewed by AngelList Advisors, LLC, the funds’ investment adviser. AngelList Advisors, LLC generally follows Davidovs Venture Capital's investment recommendation in allocating the funds' capital but may reject on-thesis investment opportunities in its sole discretion when Davidovs Venture Capital discloses a conflict of interest or due to other extenuating circumstances. AngelList Advisors, LLC is an exempt reporting adviser.
    
- **Do funds in this Program have minimum or maximum investment sizes?**
    
    The funds’ minimum investment into a portfolio company will be $20,000. The funds in this Program will not have maximum investment sizes into portfolio companies.
    
- **What happens if funds in this Program do not invest their total capital each quarter?**
    
    A fund will deploy capital into investments until the end of its investment period, which usually occurs at the end of a quarter.
    
    If any quarterly fund in the Program does not invest all of its investable capital during its investment period, LPs' proportionate share of capital that is not held back for fund expenses may be automatically reinvested into the next quarterly fund. Such rollover amounts are treated as additional capital contribution on top of an LP's existing quarterly subscription amount. LPs are not guaranteed rollover contributions and the General Partner may elect to distribute such amounts directly to LPs at the end of a quarterly fund's investment period. Any rejected amount will be returned to a subscriber's AngelList investor account.
    
- **What happens to uninvested capital at the end of the quarter?**
    
    If a fund does not deploy all of its capital in one quarter, the remaining balance will be rolled automatically into the next quarter’s fund as additional capital contributions from the participating LPs. The rolled-over capital is not double-charged management or platform fees.
    
    By default, an LP's portion of uninvested capital will roll into the next quarterly fund unless:
    
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and the fund has more than 90 LPs, or
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and their roll-over contribution would be less than 10% of their subscription amount.
    
    Example:
    
    - An LP subscribes at $25K/qtr for four quarters ($100k total). The LP stops their subscription in Q5. The GP only invested $50K (inclusive of fees and expenses) of the $100K from that LP in the first four quarters.
    - If the fund has more than 90 LPs:
        - The LP’s uninvested $50K would be returned at the start of Q5. This helps keep funds below [investor limits](https://help.venture.angel.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402416430605).
    - If the fund has less than 90 LPs:
        - The LP’s uninvested $50K would be contributed into the Q5 fund. This helps maximize investable capital
    
    The fund manager can override this default policy for any and all LPs upon request.

    Example of transactions
    
    The rollover has the following mechanics - the uninvested part will be refunded into the investor’s AngelList account and automatically contributed to the next quarterly fund on their behalf. No action is needed from the investors, and the transaction history will look the following way:
    
    ![Untitled](FAQ%20-%20Rolling%20Fund%20726de7d66bf24cbb94eca69ff0384bc6/Untitled.png)
    
    ****Notice**: AngelList’s default policy is usually to automatically reinvest the uninvested part of the capital into the next fund. This is because an LP is committing a certain amount to the GP, and AngelList fulfills that by rolling over the capital so that the GP can invest what was intended by the LP. However, AngelList can return the excess capital if the GP or LP requests it.*
    
- **What happens when an LP cancels** their **subscription?**
    
    When an LP cancels their subscription, any undeployed capital from that quarter is typically returned to that LP. The canceling LP will not receive any portion of their admin of management fees back. If an LP cancels their subscription after the quarter has ended, the rollover capital is usually not returned since it has already been allocated to the next quarter's fund. DVC usually deploys most of their quarterly capital, so even once capital is rolled over, this will not be a very large amount. 
    
    *The canceling LP would not receive any portion of the management fee or admin fee back.
    
    Example:
    
    - LP puts in $25k/qtr for four quarters
    
    - LP doesn’t continue their subscription from Q5 on
    
    - GP only invested $50k (inclusive of fees and expenses) of the $100k from that LP
    
    - The LP’s uninvested capital would be returned (minus fees and expenses).
    
    Undeployed capital is usually *rolled over* into the next quarter unless the following criteria are met:
    
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and the fund has more than 90 LPs, or
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and their roll-over contribution would be less than 10% of their subscription amount.
    
    **After canceling subscription**
    
    This process starts at the beginning of the quarter and typically takes about four weeks to be finalized.
    
    Once completed, if LP is no longer participating in the fund, LP will receive a refund that will be posted to LP’s [Funding Dashboard](https://venture.angellist.com/v/albert-kashipov/i/albert-kashipov/funding-accounts/albert-kashipov-individual) by the end of the first month of the quarter. Once the funds are deposited, LP will be alerted via an automated email. Lp can then transfer the refund back to LP’s bank account.
    
- **When will LPs learn about companies the funds invested in?**
    
    There is no guarantee that LPs in the Program will receive information about the funds and underlying portfolio companies. Fund updates, if any, will be provided solely at Davidovs Venture Capital's discretion.
    
- **Can LPs opt out of specific deals?**
    
    No. LPs are subscribing to invest in a series of consecutively offered quarterly funds, in exchange for access to the funds' investments. LPs cannot choose whether to invest in specific deals.
    
- **Can LPs sell their investment in the fund?**
    
    LPs generally cannot sell or transfer their interest outside of serious events like death or divorce.
    
- **Can LPs redeem their interests in the fund?**
    
    No, LPs generally do not have the right to redeem their interests.
    
- **When will funds launched under this Program begin deploying capital?**
    
    The initial quarterly fund in this Program may warehouse investments or otherwise deploy all or a portion of its capital prior to accepting and closing investor subscriptions.
    
- **How do I receive tax documents from this Program?**
    
    Each LP will receive a Schedule K-1 tax document for each quarterly fund to which they are subscribed. To streamline reporting, AngelList will aggregate all relevant K-1s into a single package, which will be sent to each LP.
    
- **What happens to uninvested capital at the end of the quarter?**
    
    If a fund does not deploy all of its capital in one quarter, the remaining balance will be rolled automatically into the next quarter’s fund as additional capital contributions from the participating LPs. The rolled-over capital is not double-charged management or platform fees.
    
    By default, an LP's portion of uninvested capital will roll into the next quarterly fund unless:
    
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and the fund has more than 90 LPs, or
    - An LP has canceled their subscription, and their roll-over contribution would be less than 10% of their subscription amount.
    
    Example:
    
    - An LP subscribes at $25K/qtr for four quarters ($100k total). The LP stops their subscription in Q5. The GP only invested $50K (inclusive of fees and expenses) of the $100K from that LP in the first four quarters.
    - If the fund has more than 90 LPs:
        - The LP’s uninvested $50K would be returned at the start of Q5. This helps keep funds below [investor limits](https://help.venture.angel.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402416430605).
    - If the fund has less than 90 LPs:
        - The LP’s uninvested $50K would be contributed into the Q5 fund. This helps maximize investable capital
    
    The fund manager can override this default policy for any and all LPs upon request.

    When an LP cancels their subscription, any undeployed capital from that quarter is typically returned to that LP. The canceling LP will not receive any portion of their admin of management fees back. If an LP cancels their subscription after the quarter has ended, the rollover capital is usually not returned since it has already been allocated to the next quarter's fund. DVC usually deploys most of their quarterly capital, so even once capital is rolled over, this will not be a very large amount. 
    
    *The canceling LP would not receive any portion of the management fee or admin fee back.

    - LP puts in $25k/qtr for four quarters
    
    - LP doesn’t continue their subscription from Q5 on

Once the funds are deposited, LP will be alerted via an automated email. Lp can then transfer the refund back to LP’s bank account.
    
- **How does the management fee work for the rolled-over capital?**
    
    Funds on AngelList only charge management fees once. No management fees are charged on any portion of the rolled-over capital since the fees have already been charged upfront from the original fund in which the money has been invested. This ensures that the quarterly fund has enough capital to pay management and admin fees for future quarters.
    
    The estimated calculations would be like this:
    
    - LP subscription - $30k committed capital - $6k (management fees) - $450 (admin fees) = $23,550 in investable capital for 4 quarters = $94,200 could be deployed. Any portion of the undeployed capital will be rolled-over net of fees.
- **How is deal-by-deal carry calculated?**
    - Deal by deal carry is split on a percentage basis on the profit of a single investment. This is done via our platform through an interest transfer agreement. Carry is paid out when LPs receive a distribution from a portfolio company. At distribution, LPs will first receive the amount equal to their initial investment. Then, carry is taken from profit.
    - Please see attached a sample carry share agreement with detail. Since the agreement is an interest transfer, there is no obligation to payout carry until the distribution process.
    - **Can there be a shared carry payout obligation if there is no carry yet?**
        - If there is no carry, there is no shared carry payout obligation.
    - **Can we set a maximum percentage of the carry from the total carry pool? I.e. "2% of carried interest on this deal but not more than 30% of GP's carried interest for this fund"?**
        - Our platform is limited to sharing a percentage of carry. We cannot set a maximum percentage of the carry from the total carry pool.
