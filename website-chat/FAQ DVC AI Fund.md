# FAQ DVC AI Fund I

## GPs

- **GP bio and background**
    
    DVC was founded by Marina and Nick Davidovs, a family of founders with 15 years of experience in early-stage VC and product building, including 9 years focused on AI, and with multiple successful exits. 3 more partners (GP) include a former Yahoo and Google exec with multiple unicorns invested in seed, an ex-Meta, and Google AI product director, and an Oscar-winning filmmaker who sold his tech startup to Microsoft. Everyone in GP is a founder, technical, and with at least 10+ years investing as a VC/angel.
    
    Nick and Marina Davidovs manage the DVC AI Fund alongside their $38+ rolling fund, Davidovs VC (DVC). In 3.5 years the rolling fund has invested in 120 early-stage startups by repeat founders in AI. The fund is backed by a community of limited partners, which are engineers, founders, and angel investors in Silicon Valley. The LPs actively participate in investment decisions, and portfolio management, and provide valuable expertise and network connections to portfolio founders.
    Before establishing DVC, the Davidovs co-founded Cherry Labs, an AI camera startup that was acquired post-Series A, and Gagarin Capital, an AI-focused VC fund. They have also invested in and advised numerous early-stage AI startups, such as Prisma Labs (100M+ users), MSQRD (30M users, acquired by Meta), and AIMatter (acquired by Google). Prior to these ventures, Nick served as the founding employee and Director of Investments at iTech Capital, a $120M seed/series A VC firm with notable seed/A investments in Trading View ($3.5B), Bitfury ($2B), and Ecwid ($500M).

## DVC **AI** Fund

- **What is the DVC AI Fund Thesis?**
    
    The GP intends to do some part (up to $500k) of the on-thesis deals from the DVC Rolling Fund first (not later than Series A) if the Rolling Fund hasn't invested $500k already. DVC AI ****Fund does not plan to do deals involving non-convertible debt, crypto tokens, or real-estate-based instruments.
    
- **Does the AI Fund conflict with the Rolling Fund?**
    
    The AI Fund may invest in companies where Davidovs Venture Capital's Rolling Fund already has or had investments (called "Follow-on Opportunities"). The Rolling Fund has the exclusive right to invest up to $500,000 in early funding rounds (like Series A Preferred Stock). If the Rolling Fund doesn’t fully invest in these rounds, or the opportunity is larger, the AI Fund may have a chance to invest, as decided by the Investment Committee.
    
    For later rounds (Series B or beyond), the AI Fund can also participate, depending on the Investment Committee's decision. However, investments follow AngelList's Allocation Policy, which could change over time, meaning there’s no guarantee the AI Fund will always have access to these opportunities.
    
- **What is the lifespan of the AI Fund?**
    
    The lifespan: 10 years.
    
- **Over how many months will you deploy capital?**
    
    Capital will be deployed over 4 years (48 months).
    
- **Where will the majority of your portfolio companies be based?**
    
    The majority of the portfolio companies will be based in the United States and the United Kingdom.
    
- **What is the minimum and/or maximum investment amount?**
    
    The minimum investment amount is $500,000. The maximum investment amount is $30 million.
    
- **Would the AI Fund be able to invest in other funds?**
    
    Yes, the fund can invest in other funds. 
    
    SEC guidelines dictate that we can invest up to 20% of the fund’s capital into non-qualifying investments. Investments into other funds are generally [“non-qualifying” investments (NQI)](https://help.angellist.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048894632) .
    
- **Would your fund be able to invest in digital assets (e.g. crypto assets/tokens)?**
    
    No, the fund will not invest in digital assets.
    
- **Would distributions be recycled back into the fund?**
    
    Yes, distributions will be recycled back into the fund.
    
    **What is the maximum percentage of the fund size that can be recycled?**
    
    Up to 20% of the fund size can be recycled.
    
- **Does the Fund have investment transfers?**
    
    Yes, 2 investments in [Perplexity.ai](http://Perplexity.ai) and Kick have been made and will be transferred to the AI Fund.
    
- **What entity advises this fund?**

    ![Screen Shot 2024-05-23 at 19.24.17.png](FAQ%20DVC%20AI%20Fund%20I%2036e6d05a2c2142a189c8eedcf4ec9c25/Screen_Shot_2024-05-23_at_19.24.17.png)
    
- **How much capital are GPs contributing to the fund?**
    
    The General Partners (GPs) contribute 2% of the fund size.
    
- **What is the minimum investment amount required to participate in capital calls?**
    
    Investors who invest less than the minimum will be required to fund their entire commitment upfront. The capital call investment minimum is $100,000.
    
- **Is there an option for a full or partial exit before the end of the 10 years of the fund's existence?**
    
    Yes, a full or partial exit is possible through the sale of shares. However, buyers of the shares must be approved by the General Partner (GP).
    
- **What happens to investors' funds when the fund exits a startup? Are the funds reinvested in new ventures or distributed back to the investors?**
    
    Funds are distributed to investors' AngelList accounts. The fund reserves the right to reinvest up to 20% of the funds if the exit occurs too early in the investment period.
    
- **What triggers the fund's exit from a portfolio company?**
    
    The fund's exit from a portfolio company is an investment decision based on various factors, including the duration of the investment, the possibility of a profitable exit, and the presence of a premium on the share price.
    
    - **Founder Liquidity Event**: If the founders decide to sell a significant portion of their shares, the fund often exits alongside the founders, as the investment thesis is largely based on backing the leadership team.
    - **Strategic Exit Opportunity**: When a clear opportunity for a profitable exit arises, such as a strategic acquisition, IPO, or secondary market transaction where the share price reflects a premium valuation, the fund will capitalize on the opportunity.
    - **Fund Closure**: The fund may also exit when it reaches its natural end, requiring a full or partial liquidation of its portfolio positions.
- **How are the funds of the new fund distributed in terms of the number of startups, sectors/niches within AI, and stages? Are these all follow-ons in current companies or will there be new ones? What is the ratio?**
    
    75% follow-ons from Rolling fund (inherited from the distribution of the seed fund with adjustments for selecting the best among them), 25% AI startups outside the seed fund portfolio.
    
- **How do you streamline high-volume deal investments per quarter with a small team?**
    
    We ultimately see VC as a numbers game where to drive returns we need to improve 2 factors without increasing the fund size: the number of shots at the target and the quality of these shots. In our previous funds at iTech Capital, we were investing in 6x fewer deals per quarter due to critical choke points:
    
    - Fewer deals at the top of the pipeline
    - Long deal review process (pre-call research → first call → additional research → deal memo → getting expert opinions → IC review → deal negotiations)
    - Extended due diligence process
    - Time-consuming term sheet and definitive agreement negotiations (particularly when leading)
    - Manual reporting burden on portfolio founders
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-11-08 at 17.49.29.png](FAQ%20DVC%20AI%20Fund%20I%2036e6d05a2c2142a189c8eedcf4ec9c25/Screen_Shot_2024-11-08_at_17.49.29.png)
    
    This is how it looked like (more or less standard flow for the industry) This approach made us slow, created unnecessary founder distraction (see all arrows going back to the founder each time an additional person starts working on the deal), and formalized relationships to the point where meaningful help was limited to board-level engagement. After the first-principles analysis, we've reinvented the process using AI-based automation and our community of LPs and portfolio founders.
    
    ## The Solution: More Shots, Better Aim
    
    This is how we optimized this to source more deals, close them faster, and provide more value to the founders (so they refer us to other founders which is a flywheel for more deals sourced):
    
    ![Screen Shot 2024-11-08 at 17.50.39.png](FAQ%20DVC%20AI%20Fund%20I%2036e6d05a2c2142a189c8eedcf4ec9c25/Screen_Shot_2024-11-08_at_17.50.39.png)
    
    ### 1. Increasing Pipeline Volume
    
    - **Deal Captain Program**: LPs serve as Venture Partners with deal-by-deal carry-sharing across funds and SPVs. We've armed them with:
        - Quick-add pipeline tools
        - Automated initial research capabilities
        - AI-powered memo generation
        - Access to collective expertise
        - Weekend VC educational resources
        - Current impact: ~25% of dealflow
    - **Community-Driven Dealflow**:
        - Founder referrals through consistent value delivery
        - Cross-pollination events (15-16 early-stage GPs each bringing active investments)
        - AI-enhanced industry research based on collective expert insights
    
    ### 2. Accelerating Deal Execution
    
    - **Automated Initial Analysis**:
        - Forward email/deck to AI agent for comprehensive research
        - Automatic memo generation with structured follow-up questions
        - Centralized information hub (Airtable + frontend) preventing duplicate founder queries
    - **Streamlined Due Diligence**:
        - Focus on founder and product validation
        - Leave financial and legal DD to round leads
        - Expert LP engagement through the DVC platform or quick messenger queries
        - Biweekly pipeline calls for collective insight
    - **Standardized Closing Process**:
        - AngelList integration for fund admin and back office
        - Automated deal submission, doc review, and wire transfers
    
    ### 3. Smarter Portfolio Engagement
    
    - **AI-Powered Reporting**:
        - Eliminated custom reporting requirements
        - AI extraction of quantifiable data
        - Automated identification of support opportunities
        - LP advisor compensation through deal-specific carry
    - **Strategic Support vs. Governance**:
        - No board or observer seats
        - Position as a trusted advisor
        - Pre-board preparation support
        - Better information access through informal channels
    
    This redesigned process allows us to take more shots without sacrificing quality while building stronger founder relationships that drive our dealflow flywheel. We see our firm as a product, measure founder and LP retention and engagement, and constantly iterate to get better. In the future we see our community as a platform for thousands of expert angels wishing to become weekend VCs and working through pre-seed and seed rolling funds, and providing value to the collective portfolio. We will be raising growth funds (like our current one) every 4 years to write checks to the best-performing seed startups and provide the collective with more leverage and resources.
    
- **What is the schedule for Capital Calls? How much will be requested in each call? Can we invest 100% of our commitment right away instead of waiting for capital calls?**
    
    The first Capital Call will be for 30% of your commitment, followed by additional calls every six months. Immediate investment of 100% of your commitment is possible.
    
    - LP receives through the AngelList platform capital calls and updates on tax reporting.
- **What is the distribution waterfall? Is there a hurdle rate?**
    
    There is no hurdle rate. The distribution waterfall allocates 100% to Limited Partners (LPs) before reaching 1x, and then an 80/20 split after reaching 1x.
    
- **Is the fund registered as an LP in Delaware?**
    
    Yes, the fund is registered in Delaware.
    
    The address of LP and LLC is: 
    
    900 Foulk Road, Suite 201, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19803
    
- **How frequently will you be sending reports on the fund?**
    
    Reports will be sent quarterly, with audited financials provided annually.
    

## AngelList

- **AngelList Platform**
    
    The AngelList Platform is the primary hub through which AngelList fund managers and investors can manage their investment activity. All AngelList users, including members of the Fund's team and its investors, must create an AngelList user account tied to a unique email address. AngelList requires users to enable two-factor authentication on their accounts.
    
- **Roles and Responsibilities**
    
    AngelList provides services to the fund through two wholly-owned subsidiaries:
    
    1) Belltower Fund Group, Ltd. ("Belltower") acts as Fund Administrator and carries out a number of operational and administrative activities for the Fund, including fund formation, investor qualification, capital collection, investment deployment, fund accounting, financial reporting, and tax reporting.
    
    2) AL Advisors Management, Inc. ("AL Advisors") provides operational and account management support to the fund.
    
    These two entities coordinate closely with respect to fund management and share communication channels to ensure seamless coordination and transfer of information. The entities also use enterprise-level shared services for legal, compliance, finance, and HR functions.
    
    Throughout this document, "AngelList" is generally used to describe activities carried out by employees of AL Advisors, and "Belltower" is used to describe specific fund administration activities.
    
- **AngelList Interface**
    
    All LPs in the Fund have access to a dashboard on the AngelList Platform through which they can manage and monitor their investment activity. Investors may provide access to and set permissions for other users. Key features of this dashboard include the following:
    
    - LPs commit to the Fund through an automated workflow that
        - (1) enables the LP to set up an investment entity on the AngelList system and
        - (2) requests information for KYC/AML and accreditation screening. When this process is completed, LPs confirm their commitment and an e-signature certificate is produced in lieu of physically signed documents.
        
        All AngelList users are required to complete this process, but AngelList's Investor Relations team may provide manual assistance for institutional investors or prepare physically signed documents where necessary.
        
    - LPs use their Funding Account to manage and monitor cash. The Funding Account page includes a complete ledger of all cash movement and access to LP-specific wire instructions.
    - LPs can monitor their investments through a Portfolio page that shows investment history and, if enabled by the Fund, fund-level and investment-level valuations on a 90-day delay.
    - Any user with access to an LP's AngelList account receives all communications generated through the AngelList platform, including Fund updates and automated notifications such as capital calls and updates on tax reporting.
    - All tax reporting is available on the dashboard, and AngelList does not distribute K-1s or other tax reporting via email except for notifications that reporting updates are available.
    - Financial reporting may be available on the dashboard unless sent separately by AngelList.
    
    LPs may also interact with AngelList via email, and email inquiries are routed to subject matter experts.
    
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes**
    
    AngelList provides AML/KYC services for funds on the AngelList platform. AngelList has established an AML program to conform with the U.S. AML regulations and other applicable laws and regulations, industry best practices, and contractual obligations with its banking partners. AngelList's AML Program includes a Customer Identification Program (CIP) to identify and verify investors and beneficial owners, watchlist screening to comply with sanctions, enhanced due diligence (EDD) for politically exposed persons (PEPs) and other higher-risk customers, and transaction monitoring. Investors are re-screened against watchlists semi-annually and in connection with new investment and transaction activity. AngelList utilizes third-party vendors (Persona and Blockscore) to conduct identity verification and watchlist screening.
    
    AngelList compares names against, at a minimum, the following sanctions lists maintained by AngelList's third-party vendors for watchlist screening:
    
    **United States:**
    
    US - Bureau of Industry and Security
    
    - Entity List
    - Denied Persons List
    
    US - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
    
    - Specially Designated Nationals List
    - Foreign Sanctions Evaders
    - Palestinian Legislative Council
    - Sectoral Sanctions Identifications
    
    US - Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
    
    - AECA Debarred
    
    US - Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation
    
    - Nonproliferation Sanctions
    
    **United Kingdom:**
    
    - UK - Her Majesty's Treasury Consolidated List
    
    **Australia:**
    
    - AU - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Consolidated List
    
    **Canada:**
    
    - CA - Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)
    - CA - Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Regulations (JVCFOR)
    - CA - United Nations Act
    
    **Global:**
    
    - UN - United Nations Security Council Consolidated List
- **AngelList Networked Banking**
    
    AngelList maintains partnerships with **Grasshopper Bank, Fifth Third Bank, and Piermont Bank**, which operate segregated FBO accounts for the Fund and all investors in the fund. These banking partners operate sweep accounts on AngelList's behalf, through which cash is allocated among segregated accounts at more than 20 banks in $250,000 increments on a daily basis, expanding FDIC insurance eligibility up to $125M for Fund accounts and up to $5.25M for individual LP investing accounts.
    
    These FBO accounts are held under a single omnibus account, but each Fund sub-account and investor sub-account has a unique account number with a distinct audit trail. Cash is not commingled except in limited circumstances (described below). Our FBO program is opened under the auspices of the Bank, with AngelList as the designated program manager.
    
- **Fund Cash Management**
    
    **LP Contributions**
    
    All prospective investors in the Fund must successfully complete AngelList's KYC/AML screening (described above). Upon completion of KYC/AML screening, AngelList will automatically open an FBO sub-account for the investor and supply distinct wire instructions through e-mail or the AngelList platform. Wire instructions will include a unique memo code that will automatically route transferred funds to the Fund's FBO account or a specific investment, as applicable.
    
    Investors may also choose to send funds via an ACH transfer (through a Plaid integration) or a crypto transfer (via USDC). Solo or retail investors primarily utilize these services.
    
    Cash wired by investors is not commingled except in limited circumstances where the investor has not completed KYC/AML screening but has obtained wire instructions and completed a transfer. For example, this could arise if an investor has previously made an investment through the AngelList platform using a different (KYC/AML screened) entity and uses those instructions to complete a transfer intended for an entity that has not yet passed KYC/AML screening. In these cases, the cash would be recorded in Treasury but may temporarily be commingled with other funds pending completion of KYC/AML screening before being transferred to the Fund's account.
    
    **LP Distributions**
    
    Upon a distribution from the Fund, cash is distributed to the LP's FBO account. To withdraw the cash, LPs must log into their AngelList account, designate a bank account to receive a wire or ACH and initiate the transaction.
    
- **Exit Distributions**
    
    Upon learning of an exit or other event resulting in the Fund receiving distributable proceeds, Belltower coordinates with the counterparty to arrange receipt of payment or securities. The received amount is recorded in Comptroller, which automatically calculates distribution amounts for each LP or carry recipient. Members of Belltower's Investment Operations team review the calculation for accuracy and then distribute a distribution model to the Fund for review and approval (which is required to initiate the distribution). The final distribution data is recorded automatically by Comptroller to enable tax reporting, financial reporting, and calculations of future distributions.
    
    Where an exit event results in the Fund receiving securities, Belltower enables the Fund to determine whether to (1) liquidate the securities for cash distribution or (2) offer LPs the ability to elect to receive cash or securities. All such elections are made through the AngelList Platform. Where an LP fails or declines to make an election, the LP's distribution defaults to cash.
    
- **Tax Reporting**
    
    Belltower's Tax team initiates tax reporting, including partnership returns and K-1s, through Comptroller. Estimates are generally available to the Fund and its LPs within 75 days of year-end, and finalized reports by March 31 of each year. Where Belltower's Tax team requires additional information or preparation steps, the Fund and its LPs are notified of any delays and provided with updates on an ongoing basis.
    
- **AngelList - Corporate Overview**
