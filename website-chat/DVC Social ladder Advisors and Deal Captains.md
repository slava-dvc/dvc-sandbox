# DVC social ladder: Advisors and Deal Captains

One of the most critical pillars in building a community is creating the social ladder - an opportunity for community members to be engaged, add more value, and grow. By talking to our LPs, we realized there are two paths for community members: Advisors and Deal Captains. LPs willing to actively contribute to the fund can start working with the fund's portfolio companies and bring in and lead new deals.

**A Deal Advisor** role is perfect for an LP who wants to share specific expertise with a portfolio company, contributing their time and resources and receiving a percentage of the fund's carried interest for this deal. We are inviting everyone interested in becoming a Deal Advisor to share their expertise with the fund leads so we can better address requests from portfolio companies and nominate new Deal Advisors.

**A Deal Captain** path is perfect for an LP who wants to participate in the investment management process and dive into VC deeper. A Deal Captain is responsible for bringing a new deal for which they will act as a single gateway into the DVC community. A Deal Captain receives a % of the carried interest and can grow into a Venture Partner, managing multiple deals and contributing a few hours per month to work with them and the fund's team.

The same person can be a Deal Advisor for one company and a Deal Captain for another.

Deal Advisors can flexibly work with DVC portfolio companies in their own time. In contrast, Deal Captains have to take on the responsibility of being the investment managers for a portfolio company: participating in due diligence, the investment decision, reporting, follow-on investments, and exit.

We are currently talking to the first batch of our Deal Advisors and Deal Captains - huge thanks to them for agreeing to be the guinea pigs and learn by doing together with us. The result of this work will be a “weekend VC playbook” that would enable the members of our community to be effective venture capitalists without a significant time commitment.
