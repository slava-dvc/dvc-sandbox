# DVC Community

The fund is backed by a community of limited partners, which are engineers, founders, and angel investors in Silicon Valley. The LPs actively participate in investment decisions and portfolio management and provide valuable expertise and network connections to portfolio founders.

Active and most value-added investors in our community become Deal Advisors, Deal Captains, or Venture Partners in the fund and share the carried interest.

We aim to be one of the most value-added investors on their cap tables. By joining our community, founders can help each other, and we can provide support to them by connecting them with our LPs. It helps us to establish such a relationship with them that founders would take us into competitive deals and recommend us to others.

Today, our collective already comprises over 354 outstanding members, including 200+ founders and 150 LPs!

Community statistics:

- 94% of us are immigrants (mostly from Eastern Europe)
- 90% work in tech
- 60% live in the US (mostly in CA)
- 60% work as engineers
- 100**%** of us pledged to help startups that we invest in

About 1/3 are founders and unicorn founders; 1/3 work in Big Tech, and 1/3 are active VCs or Angels.

### Community Meetings:

Throughout the fund's journey, we've hosted over 100+ DVC events, creating essential opportunities for communication and connection.
