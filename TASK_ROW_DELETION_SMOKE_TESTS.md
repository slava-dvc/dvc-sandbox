# Task Row Deletion Smoke Tests

## Overview
Tests for the new native row deletion feature using `st.data_editor` with `num_rows="dynamic"`. This provides built-in trash icons for each row.

## Prerequisites
1. Navigate to a company page in the Synapse dashboard
2. Go to the "Tasks" tab
3. Ensure you have at least 1 active task and 1 completed task for testing

---

## Test 1: Active Tasks Row Deletion

### Steps to Test:
1. Go to the Tasks tab on any company page
2. Look at the active tasks table
3. **You should see trash icons (üóëÔ∏è) on the right side of each active task row**
4. Click the trash icon for any active task

### Expected Results:
- The row is removed from the table immediately (Streamlit's native behavior)
- A confirmation dialog appears: "‚ö†Ô∏è Delete task: '[task title]'?"
- Two buttons appear: "Yes, Delete" (primary) and "Cancel" (secondary)
- Clicking "Cancel" restores the row and hides the confirmation
- Clicking "Yes, Delete" permanently deletes the task and shows "Task deleted!" success message
- The task is removed from the database and the page refreshes

---

## Test 2: Completed Tasks Row Deletion

### Steps to Test:
1. Scroll down to the "‚úÖ Completed Tasks" expandable section
2. Expand the completed tasks section
3. **You should see trash icons (üóëÔ∏è) on the right side of each completed task row**
4. Click the trash icon for any completed task

### Expected Results:
- The row is removed from the table immediately (Streamlit's native behavior)
- A confirmation dialog appears: "‚ö†Ô∏è Delete completed task: '[task title]'?"
- Two buttons appear: "Yes, Delete" (primary) and "Cancel" (secondary)
- Clicking "Cancel" restores the row and hides the confirmation
- Clicking "Yes, Delete" permanently deletes the task and shows "Task deleted!" success message
- The task is removed from the database and the page refreshes

---

## Test 3: Uncomplete Checkbox (Still Works)

### Steps to Test:
1. In the completed tasks section, find the "Done" checkbox column
2. Uncheck the checkbox for any completed task

### Expected Results:
- The checkbox unchecks immediately
- The page refreshes automatically
- The task disappears from the completed tasks section
- The task reappears in the active tasks section
- The task retains its title, owner, due date, and notes
- The task's outcome/results are cleared (reset to empty)
- **This functionality remains unchanged from before**

---

## Test 4: Multiple Operations

### Steps to Test:
1. Delete 1 active task using trash icon
2. Uncomplete 1 task using checkbox in completed section
3. Delete 1 completed task using trash icon

### Expected Results:
- All operations work independently
- Each deletion shows its own confirmation dialog
- Task counts update correctly:
  - Active task count decreases when deleting or uncompleting
  - Completed task count decreases when deleting
  - Completed task count increases when completing tasks

---

## Test 5: Prevent Adding New Rows

### Steps to Test:
1. Try to add a new row using the "+" button at the bottom of the active tasks table
2. Try to add a new row using the "+" button at the bottom of the completed tasks table

### Expected Results:
- Warning message appears: "Adding new tasks is not allowed here. Use the 'Add new task' form above."
- The new row is removed and table returns to original state
- Users must use the "Add new task" form at the top to create new tasks

---

## Test 6: Cancel Operations

### Steps to Test:
1. Click trash icon on an active task, then click "Cancel"
2. Click trash icon on a completed task, then click "Cancel"

### Expected Results:
- Both cancel operations restore the deleted rows
- No changes are made to the database
- The confirmation dialogs disappear
- Tasks remain in their original state

---

## Visual Changes to Expect

### Before (Old Implementation):
- Separate "Actions" section with delete buttons below the table
- Delete buttons were positioned outside the table

### After (New Implementation):
- **Trash icons (üóëÔ∏è) appear directly on each row** - this is the key visual change
- **No separate actions section** - everything is inline with the table
- **Cleaner, more professional appearance** - follows standard data editing patterns
- **Consistent with other data editing apps** - users will immediately understand how to delete rows

---

## Edge Cases to Verify

### Edge Case 1: Last Active Task
- Delete the last active task using trash icon
- Expected: "No active tasks" message appears, completed tasks section still works

### Edge Case 2: Last Completed Task
- Delete the last completed task using trash icon
- Expected: Completed tasks section becomes empty

### Edge Case 3: Rapid Operations
- Try to delete multiple tasks rapidly
- Expected: Each deletion shows its own confirmation dialog, no conflicts

### Edge Case 4: Adding New Rows
- Try to add new rows using the + button
- Expected: Warning message appears and rows are removed, directing users to use the form above

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Trash icons appear on the right side of each table row
‚úÖ Clicking trash icon removes row and shows confirmation dialog
‚úÖ Confirmation shows task title for clarity
‚úÖ Cancel button restores the row
‚úÖ Yes, Delete button permanently deletes the task
‚úÖ Uncomplete checkbox still works for returning tasks to active
‚úÖ No separate "Actions" section needed
‚úÖ Clean, professional appearance

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Uses `num_rows="dynamic"` in `st.data_editor`
- Row deletion detection: compares `len(edited_df) < len(df)`
- Deleted task identification: `original_ids - remaining_ids`
- Confirmation using session state flags
- Database deletion via `delete_task(task_id)`
- Automatic page refresh after operations
