# Task Dialog Refactor Smoke Tests

## Overview
Comprehensive test scenarios to validate the refactored task dialog system eliminates ghost dialogs, race conditions, and state inconsistencies.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Single Task Completion Flow
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Tasks tab for any company
2. Ensure there is at least one active task visible
3. Click the checkbox to mark task as "Done"
4. Verify dialog appears immediately with task details
5. Click "Save Results" with meaningful text (10+ chars)
6. Verify task moves to completed section
7. Verify no ghost dialogs remain

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Dialog appears immediately after checkbox click
- ✅ Task status changes to `pending_result` while dialog is open
- ✅ Task moves to completed section after save
- ✅ No ghost dialogs or session state pollution
- ✅ Debug panel shows clean state after completion

### 2. Last Task Completion (Critical Bug Fix)
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Tasks tab with exactly one active task
2. Click checkbox to complete the last task
3. Verify dialog still appears (no early return bug)
4. Save or cancel the dialog
5. Verify "No active tasks" message appears correctly

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Dialog appears even when completing the last task
- ✅ No early return prevents dialog from showing
- ✅ Proper empty state message after completion
- ✅ Clean session state in debug panel

### 3. Dialog Cancel Functionality
**Steps:**
1. Click checkbox to complete any active task
2. Verify dialog appears with task details
3. Click "Cancel" button
4. Verify task returns to active status
5. Verify task remains in active tasks list
6. Verify dialog closes completely

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Task reverts to `active` status after cancel
- ✅ Task remains visible in active tasks list
- ✅ No ghost dialogs or session state pollution
- ✅ Clean state restoration

### 4. Rapid Checkbox Clicks (Race Condition Prevention)
**Steps:**
1. Click checkbox rapidly multiple times on same task
2. Verify only one dialog appears
3. Complete the dialog (save or cancel)
4. Verify no race conditions or duplicate dialogs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Only one dialog appears despite rapid clicks
- ✅ No duplicate session state entries
- ✅ Atomic session updates prevent race conditions
- ✅ Clean state after completion

### 5. Multiple Tasks with Mixed Operations
**Steps:**
1. Create 3-4 active tasks
2. Complete one task (save results)
3. Start completing another task, then cancel
4. Complete a third task
5. Verify all operations work correctly
6. Check debug panel for clean state

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Multiple tasks can be processed independently
- ✅ User-scoped session keys prevent conflicts
- ✅ Each task maintains separate dialog state
- ✅ Clean session state after all operations

### 6. Tab Switching Cleanup
**Steps:**
1. Start completing a task (dialog appears)
2. Switch to different tab/company
3. Return to original tab
4. Verify no ghost dialogs remain
5. Check debug panel for clean state

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tab switching clears orphaned dialog state
- ✅ No ghost dialogs persist across navigation
- ✅ Session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ✅ Clean state in debug panel

### 7. Debug Panel State Inspection
**Steps:**
1. Enable debug panel: "🐛 Show task debug state"
2. Perform various task operations
3. Monitor session state changes in sidebar
4. Verify only relevant keys are present
5. Verify old keys are cleaned up properly

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Debug panel shows current session state
- ✅ Only user-scoped keys present during operations
- ✅ Old keys are cleaned up after operations
- ✅ No legacy key pollution

### 8. Error Handling Validation
**Steps:**
1. Simulate network/DB error (if possible)
2. Try to complete a task with invalid data
3. Verify error messages appear
4. Verify no broken state results
5. Verify recovery is possible

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Error messages appear for failed operations
- ✅ No broken session state after errors
- ✅ User can retry operations after errors
- ✅ Clean error recovery

### 9. Performance and Caching
**Steps:**
1. Load page with many tasks (10+)
2. Switch between Active/Completed/All views rapidly
3. Verify responsive performance
4. Check that caching improves rerun speed

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Fast view switching with cached filtering
- ✅ Responsive UI during rapid operations
- ✅ No performance degradation with many tasks
- ✅ Caching reduces redundant computations

### 10. User-Scoped State Isolation
**Steps:**
1. Test with different user contexts (if available)
2. Verify user-scoped session keys work correctly
3. Verify no cross-user state pollution
4. Test with anonymous user fallback

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ User-scoped keys prevent cross-user conflicts
- ✅ Anonymous user fallback works correctly
- ✅ No state pollution between users
- ✅ Proper key scoping: `{user_id}_{task_id}_show_dialog`

## Debug Commands

### Enable Debug Panel
```python
# In sidebar, check "🐛 Show task debug state"
# Monitor session state in real-time
```

### Manual Session State Inspection
```python
# Check for old keys that should be cleaned up
old_keys = [k for k in st.session_state.keys() 
           if k.endswith("_show_dialog") or k.endswith("_task_info")]
print("Old keys:", old_keys)

# Check for user-scoped keys
user_keys = [k for k in st.session_state.keys() 
            if "_" in k and ("show_dialog" in k or "task_info" in k)]
print("User-scoped keys:", user_keys)
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ No ghost dialogs after save/cancel operations
- ✅ Last task completion shows dialog correctly
- ✅ No task disappearing/flickering during status changes
- ✅ Consistent behavior with 1 or many tasks
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ User-scoped session keys prevent conflicts
- ✅ Atomic session state updates prevent race conditions
- ✅ Comprehensive session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ✅ Centralized status configuration eliminates hardcoded strings
- ✅ Cached filtering improves performance
- ✅ Debug panel enables state inspection

### User Experience Requirements

## Implementation Verification

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `synapse/app/shared/task_config.py` - Centralized status constants
2. ✅ `synapse/app/dashboard/task_state_controller.py` - User-scoped helpers
3. ✅ `synapse/app/dashboard/tasks.py` - Main refactoring
4. ✅ `synapse/app/dashboard/dialog_utils.py` - Dialog cleanup
5. ✅ `synapse/app/dashboard/all_tasks.py` - Status check updates

### Key Improvements
- ✅ State isolation with user-scoped session keys
